Hello!

How to use it:

Just follow the instructions as it says when you run it. Make sure not to put in letters when it asks for numbers, or the other way around, as i haven't come to adding error handling yet.

basically how it works is, ive got "library", "user", and "Book" objects. These basically the their data as we go trough the code, for example in library itll show all the books, and all the loaned books.
In book it stores all the info about the specific books (Think title, genre, etc.). These objects are what get put in the library objects lists aswell, where it stores all the books.

Then for user its basically the same as book. It stores your username, password, and id. These are then an object in Program.
Also, when you wanna add a bookit first checks if you're a premium user. Yes? It runs the addbook in "premiumUser.cs". No? it runs the one in Book, which basically just says  you have to be a premiumUser 
in order to add a book. This is how i learnt/used polymorphism and inheritance.

Thats basically it, have fun reading through my code!
